# Taxonomic Timelines: Feature-level Analysis in Longitudinal Studies

**Delving into the depths of longitudinal microbiome data requires a robust toolkit. Fortunately, MicrobiomeStat arms us with a set of powerful functions to illuminate the intricate taxonomic changes over time.**

### **Longitudinal Taxa Trend Test Generation**

This function is designed to **conduct a longitudinal trend test on microbiome data**. The primary aim is to discern how the abundance of various microbial taxa changes over time and/or in response to different experimental or observational groups. The function delivers **robust statistical insights** that enable researchers to draw meaningful conclusions about the dynamics of microbial populations.

#### **Example:**
```R
data("subset_T2D.obj")
generate_taxa_trend_test_long(
  data.obj = subset_T2D.obj,
  subject.var = "subject_id",
  time.var = "visit_number_num",
  group.var = "subject_race",
  adj.vars = "sample_body_site",
  prev.filter = 0.1,
  abund.filter = 0.001,
  feature.level = c("Genus","Family"),
  feature.dat.type = c("count")
)
```

This function returns a **detailed results table**, exposing significant taxonomic differences between groups over time. With this, a comprehensive exploration of the microbiome dynamics is more feasible and effective.

### **Longitudinal Taxa Abundance Volatility Test**

This function calculates the **volatility of taxa abundances** in longitudinal microbiome data, testing for association between abundance volatility and a grouping variable. Volatility is calculated as the mean absolute difference in abundance between consecutive time points, normalized by the time difference.

#### **Usage:**
```R
data("subset_T2D.obj")
generate_taxa_volatility_test_long(
  data.obj = subset_T2D.obj,
  time.var = "visit_number_num",
  subject.var = "subject_id",
  group.var = "subject_race",
  adj.vars = "sample_body_site",
  prev.filter = 0.1,
  abund.filter = 0.0001,
  feature.mt.method = "fdr",
  feature.sig.level = 0.1,
  feature.level = c("Genus", "Family", "Species"),
  feature.dat.type = "count",
  transform = "CLR"
)
```

This function calculates the **volatility within each subject**, and tests for association with the grouping variable using linear models. It transforms the abundance data first before volatility calculation, providing a more accurate representation of the microbiome data dynamics.

Armed with these tools from MicrobiomeStat, delving into the intricacies of microbial community patterns and shifts over time is now more **insightful and precise than ever before**.

Next, let's explore `generate_taxa_areaplot_long()` to visualize the abundance trajectories of specific taxa across multiple timepoints:

```R
generate_taxa_areaplot_long(
  data.obj = ecam.obj,
  subject.var = "studyid", 
  time.var = "month",
  group.var = "diet",
  strata.var = "antiexposedall",
  feature.level = "Family",
  feature.dat.type = "proportion",  
  feature.number = 8,
  t0.level = unique(ecam.obj$meta.dat$month)[1],
  ts.levels = unique(ecam.obj$meta.dat$month)[-1],
  base.size = 10,
  theme.choice = "bw",
  palette = NULL,
  pdf = TRUE,
  file.ann = "test"
)
```

**This longitudinal area plot allows us to track the waxing and waning of specific taxa over time, comparing trajectories between groups. The `feature.number` parameter focuses the plot on the top 8 most abundant families, providing a clear snapshot of the shifting microbial landscape.**

Moving on, let's explore `generate_taxa_barplot_long()` to gain insights into the taxonomic composition within groups at each timepoint:

```R
generate_taxa_barplot_long(
  data.obj = ecam.obj,
  subject.var = "studyid",
  time.var = "month",

  feature.dat.type = "proportion",
  feature.number = 10, 
  t0.level = NULL,
  ts.levels = NULL,
  theme.choice = "bw",
  palette = NULL,
  pdf = TRUE,
  file.ann = "test" 
)
```

Continuing our journey, `generate_taxa_boxplot_long()` offers an in-depth look at the distribution of specific phyla over time:

  group.var = "diet",
  strata.var = NULL,
  feature.level = c("Phylum"),
  features.plot = sample(unique(ecam.obj$feature.ann[,"Phylum"]),1),
  feature.dat.type = "proportion",
  transform = "log",
  prev.filter = 0,
  abund.filter = 0,
  base.size = 12,
  theme.choice = "bw",
  custom.theme = NULL,
  palette = NULL,
  pdf = TRUE,  
  file.ann = "test",
  pdf.wid = 11,
  pdf.hei = 8.5

**This visualization enables us to assess changes in central tendency and dispersion, with the ability to focus on phyla of interest using the `features.plot` parameter.**

To uncover intricate abundance change patterns, we can generate an insightful heatmap with `generate_taxa_change_heatmap_long()`:

```R
generate_taxa_change_heatmap_long(
  data.obj = ecam.obj,
  subject.var = "studyid",
  time.var = "month_num",
  t0.level = NULL,
  ts.levels = NULL,  
  group.var = "antiexposedall",
