# Feature Overview: Dive Deep into the Capabilities of MicrobiomeStat

**Data Import and Conversion**: MicrobiomeStat supports a variety of input formats from common microbiome data processing tools, including QIIME2, Mothur, DADA2, Phyloseq, and others. The supported formats currently encompass QIIME2, DADA2, BIOM, Mothur, Phyloseq, DGEList, DESeqDataSet, and SummarizedExperiment, making data importing and conversion seamless. Recognizing the dynamic landscape of microbiome research tools, we are keen to integrate more data structures commonly used within the community. If you have suggestions or utilize a particular format you'd like us to support, please don't hesitate to reach out. Your feedback drives our continuous development.&#x20;

**Cross-sectional Study Tools**: MicrobiomeStat offers functionalities for analyzing cross-sectional microbiome studies. It facilitates the **exploration of alpha and beta diversity across groups**, **assessment of taxa differential abundance**, and **evaluation of taxa prevalence variations**. For paired and longitudinal data, the tool provides options for **sub-setting by time points**, supporting detailed subgroup investigations.&#x20;

**Paired Sample Analysis**: MicrobiomeStat offers tools for **analyzing paired samples**. It facilitates the study of **alpha diversity across groups and time points**, **beta diversity in paired designs**, and **specific taxa differences**. Additionally, it allows for an exploration of **taxa composition**, **prevalence**, **abundance**, and **change patterns**. This aids in recognizing samples with **similar taxa variation patterns**, enhancing the depth of data analysis.&#x20;

**Longitudinal Study Analysis**: MicrobiomeStat provides tools for **analyzing longitudinal data**, enabling researchers to investigate **alpha and beta diversities over time**, **track taxa changes**, and **assess differences in abundance and prevalence of taxa across time points**. This facilitates a comprehensive understanding of microbiome temporal dynamics.&#x20;

**Report Generation Functions**: MicrobiomeStat features dedicated report generation functions for cross-sectional, paired, and longitudinal study designs. These functions aggregate analysis findings into comprehensive, easily interpretable reports, streamlining the communication of complex data. Additionally, we are in the process of developing a Shiny interface for even simpler one-click report generation.&#x20;

**Robust Visualization Tools**: MicrobiomeStat offers a range of visualization methods commonly utilized in microbiome research. These include **boxplot, violinplot, scatterplot, barplot, heatmap, dotplot, ordinationplot, areaplot, volcano plot,** and **spaghettiplot**. Our designs for **paired and longitudinal studies** aim to effectively convey the intricate patterns and insights within your data. With MicrobiomeStat, we strive for clarity and precision in data representation.&#x20;

**Data Export and Compatibility**: MicrobiomeStat seamlessly integrates with the **aplot** package, enabling users to effortlessly transform their analysis results into interactive visualizations.&#x20;

**Continuous Updates**: MicrobiomeStat is under active development, and we highly value feedback from our users. If there are features you'd like to see incorporated into our package, please do not hesitate to suggest them. You can share your thoughts and recommendations in the Gitbook comments section, Github Discussions, or by sending us an email. We are always eager to hear from you and improve.&#x20;
