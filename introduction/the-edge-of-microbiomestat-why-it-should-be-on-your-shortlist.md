# Exploring MicrobiomeStat: A Consideration for Your Research Toolkit

MicrobiomeStat provides comprehensive support for a wide array of input formats, accommodating the majority of formats utilized in microbiome research, including but not limited to qiime2, dada2, biom, mothur, phyloseq, DGEList, DESeqDataSet, and SummarizedExperiment. This compatibility facilitates an easy data import process. We encourage users to contact us if you encounter a format used in microbiome research that is not currently supported.

MicrobiomeStat offers a wide array of visualization styles, tailored for microbiome research. It optimizes data analysis for paired and longitudinal studies, and generates high-quality, publication-ready figures. Beyond its comprehensive support for longitudinal data analysis and visualization, MicrobiomeStat offers the flexibility to analyze and visualize individual time points. It can also be applied to cross-sectional/case-control data analysis.

MicrobiomeStat provides customizable parameters, allowing users to adapt analysis outputs to their research needs. Built with a high degree of flexibility, MicrobiomeStat is not confined to the analysis of microbiome data alone. Its versatile design extends its capabilities to accommodate and effectively analyze other omics data, making it a candidate tool for omics research and data interpretation.

Our team with rich experience in collaborative microbiome research and statistical methodological development, is committed to delivering rigorous and reproducible analysis of microbiome data.

MicrobiomeStat's outputs are compatible with the 'plotly' package, enabling users to create interactive graphics for further manipulation and customization post-analysis. The combination of time-series and individual time point analysis, along with paired samples analysis, makes MicrobiomeStat a versatile tool for comprehensive microbiome data analysis.
