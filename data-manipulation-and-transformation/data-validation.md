# Data Validation

When working with microbiome data, consistency, and correct formatting are paramount to ensure accurate and meaningful results. To assist users in maintaining the integrity and validity of their data, MicrobiomeStat offers the `mStat_validate_data()` function. This function serves as both a diagnostic and rectification tool, ensuring that your data object aligns with predefined standards.

## Function Overview

```r
mStat_validate_data(
  data.obj = obj
)
```

The function systematically evaluates key components within your data object, such as `feature.tab`, `meta.dat`, and `feature.ann`. By doing so, it confirms adherence to a set of predefined rules, ensuring data structure compliance and alignment.

## Key Validation Steps:

1. **List Verification:** The function begins by confirming that `data.obj` is of the list type. This ensures that the data object can accommodate the diverse elements necessary for comprehensive microbiome data.

2. **Metadata Frame Verification:** `meta.dat` should ideally be a dataframe. If it isn't, the function automatically converts it, ensuring that metadata is stored in a structured and queryable manner.

3. **Row Name Matching:** The row names between `feature.tab` and `feature.ann` should be identical. If any discrepancies arise, the function will rectify by matching the row names.

4. **Column-Row Matching:** The function verifies that the column names of `feature.tab` match the row names of `meta.dat`. Again, any mismatches will be corrected to ensure consistency between features and metadata.

5. **Matrix Confirmations:** Both `feature.tab` and `feature.ann` are expected to be matrices. This strict typology ensures optimal data processing in subsequent analytical steps.

6. **Additional Checks:** As data complexities evolve, more rules might be added to accommodate and validate newer data structures or elements.

### Important Reminders:

* It's worth noting that while the function can adjust certain format inconsistencies, the data components should follow base R data.frame and matrix structures. Structures specific to packages, like phyloseq's formal class, might not be directly compatible.

* While the function is comprehensive, validation success doesn't necessarily imply an absence of all possible data issues. Hence, users are encouraged to engage in supplementary data exploration to ensure the comprehensiveness and correctness of their datasets.

## Benefits:

* **Analytical Suitability:** Ensures that your data is correctly structured and ready for various analysis functions within MicrobiomeStat.
* **Error Prevention:** Anticipates and corrects possible format issues, minimizing the chances of encountering errors during analysis.
* **Data Integrity Assurance:** By regularly validating, users can be confident in the integrity of their data across operations, especially when integrating new data from diverse sources.

In conclusion, a foundational step towards achieving robust microbiome discoveries is ensuring the validity of your dataset. The `mStat_validate_data()` function is a vital tool that enables this, providing an automated means to detect and rectify format inconsistencies. Always remember: the quality of your analysis is only as good as the quality of your data.
