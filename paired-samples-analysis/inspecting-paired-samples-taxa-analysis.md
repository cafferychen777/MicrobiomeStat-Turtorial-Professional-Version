# Feature-level Analysis

In feature-level data analysis for paired samples design, the major tasks include identifying (1) features that change over time, (2) features that are differenital between groups over time,  and (3) features whose changes over time differ between groups. Features in (3) are a subset of features in (2). These tasks can be achieved by `generate_taxa_test_single` and `generate_taxa_change_test_pair`. The `generate_taxa_test_pair` function performs differential abundance analysis (DAA) based on compositional data using the mixed effects mode of LinDA, which is a DAA method based on log linear model with bias correction due to composiitonal effects. If the data are not compositional, standard linear mixed effects model (lme4) will be used.

In the `generate_taxa_test_pair` function,  `feature.dat.type` parameter specifies the data type in the feature matrix.  Depending on the data type, different preprocessing steps and methods are used.

* `count` and `proportion`: For count and proportion data, which are both compositional, `linda` will be called. To address zeros, a pseudo-count of 0.5 is added to the count data, and zeros are substituted with half of the nonzero minimum for proportion data (feature-wise).  Winorization at 97% quantile is performed to reduce the influence of outliers.
* `other`:  When `feature.dat.type` is set to "other", the data are considered to be non-compositional and standard linear mixed effects model will be used. Users need to determine the appropriate normalization and transformation of the data before running the function.  This option increases the applicability of MicrobiomeStat to other data types.

The `prev.filter` and `abund.filter` parameters filter taxa based on their prevalence and average relative abundance, so those rare and less abundant taxa will be excluded from testing. As the statistical power for these rare/less abundant taxa tends to be low, excluding them can reduce multiple testing burden. 

The `feature.level` determines what aggregation level(s) the tests will be performed. If `feature.level` is set to "original", the original features in `feature.tab`  will be tested. The `feature.level` can also be set to the aggregated levels specified in the `feature.ann` matrix.

The `generate_taxa_test_pair` outputs a table of LinDA association statistics for all tested taxa/features. The table contains the following components:

* `Variable`: It identifies the taxon/feature being analyzed.
* `Coefficient`: Expressed as log2FoldChange,  bias-corrected. It indicates the degree and direction of change in the abundance of a specific taxon/feature.
* `SE`: Standard errors of the coefficients. It measures the variability of the coefficient estimates.
* `Mean Abundance`: The average abundance of a particular taxon/feature across all samples.
* `Prevalence`: The proportion of samples where a specific taxon/feature is present.
  
The `generate_taxa_change_test_pair` function contains an additional parameter `feature.change.func`, which specifies the method or function used to compute the change between the two time points. The options include:

* `"absolute change"` (default): Computes the absolute difference between the values at the two time points (`value_time_2 - value_time_1`).
* `"log fold change"`: Computes the log2 fold change between the two time points. 
* `"relative change"`: Computes the relative change as `(value_time_2 - value_time_1) / (value_time_2 + value_time_1)`. If both time points have 0 values, the change is defined as 0.
* A custom function: If a user-defined function is provided to calculate the change, it should take two numeric vectors as input corresponding to the values at the two time points (`value_time_1` and `value_time_2`) and return a numeric vector of the computed changes. 

Results from both functions can be visualized using `generate_taxa_volcano_single`, will produce a volcano plot. It visualizes the relationship between the effect size (log foldchange) and its statistical significance. The function has the `feature.sig.level` and `feature.mt.method` parameters:
* `feature.sig.level`: This parameter determines the significance level, influencing the position of the dashed lines in the volcano plot. It sets the threshold for distinguishing between significant and non-significant differences.
* `feature.mt.method`: Thi parameter determines whether the fdr-adjusted p-values or raw p-values will be plotted . There are two options available currently: "fdr" (false discovery rate) and "none" (raw p-value).
  
By understanding and appropriately setting these parameters, users can ensure a more accurate and contextually relevant interpretation of the plotted results.

```r
#' Load the dataset

#' Perform the differential abundance test
test.list <- generate_taxa_test_pair(
  data.obj = peerj32.obj,
  subject.var = "subject",
  time.var = "time",
  group.var = "group",

For specific comparisons, labels like `$Genus$Placebo vs LGG (Reference) [Main Effect]` and `$Genus$Placebo vs LGG (Reference) [Interaction]` may appear.

* The `[Main Effect]` label indicates the primary difference in taxa abundance between the compared groups at the baseline.
* The `[Interaction]` label reveals the interaction between group differences and time variable, i.e., whether the group difference changes with the time.

If the aim is to specifically investigate the shifts in taxa abundance between the two time points, the `generate_taxa_change_test_pair()` function can be used. This function employs a linear model (lm) to evaluate the changes in taxa abundance in relation to a grouping variable.

```r
# Generate taxa change test pair
test.list <- generate_taxa_change_test_pair(
  data.obj = peerj32.obj,
  subject.var = "subject",
  time.var = "time",
  group.var = "group",
  adj.vars = c("sex"),
  change.base = "1",
  feature.change.func = "log fold change",
  feature.level = "Genus",
  prev.filter = 0.01,
  abund.filter = 0.001,
  feature.dat.type = "count"
)

# Generate the volcano plot
plot.list <- generate_taxa_volcano_single(
  data.obj = peerj32.obj,
  group.var = "group",
  test.list = test.list,
  feature.sig.level = 0.1,
  feature.mt.method = "none"
)
```

The results enable researchers to recognize taxa that exhibit notable changes in abundance across time points, and to determine whether these changes differ by group. In the following sections, we will demonstrate how to visualize taxa of interest such as those from the differential abundance analysis using various visualization tools.

First, let us look at `generate_taxa_indiv_boxplot_long()`:

```r
generate_taxa_indiv_boxplot_long(
   data.obj = peerj32.obj,
   subject.var = "subject",
   time.var = "time",
   t0.level = "1",
   ts.levels = "2",
   group.var = "group",
   strata.var = "sex",
   feature.level = c("Genus"),
   feature.dat.type = "count",
   features.plot = NULL,
   top.k.plot = NULL,
   top.k.func = NULL,
   transform = "log",
   prev.filter = 0.1,
   abund.filter = 0.001,
   base.size = 20,
   theme.choice = "bw",
   custom.theme = NULL,
   palette = NULL,
   pdf = TRUE,
   file.ann = NULL,
   pdf.wid = 11,
   pdf.hei = 8.5
)
```

This function creates a series of boxplots, one for each taxon, and outputs them into a multi-page PDF. Several parameters in this function and other related functions are noteworthy. 

* `feature.dat.type`: One of "count", "proportion" or "other".  For "count", the data will be converted to proportion data before the visualization.
* `t0.level`: the name of the baseline level ("t1") or the first time point.
* `ts.levels`: a character vector of the names of other levels to be visualized. In the paired-sample setting, `ts.levels` can be the name of the second time point ("t2")
* `transform`: This parameter indicates the transformation to apply to the abundance data when plotting. Transformations are only applied when the `feature.dat.type` is set to either "count" or "proportion".  When  `feature.dat.type` is "other",  no transformation will be performed. User should deterimne the appropriate transformation to better visualize the data. The available options for `transform` include:
  * `"identity"`: No transformation (default)
  * `"sqrt"`: Square root transformation
  * `"log"`: Logarithmic transformation. Zeros are replaced with half of the non-zero minimum  for each taxon before log transformation.
* `feature.level`: Specifiy which level of the data to be plotted.
* `features.plot`: This parameter dictates which taxa/features should be visualized. For instance, after executing a differential abundance analysis, you may only be interested in visualizing the abundance distribution of those significantly differential taxa.  When a vector of taxa/feature names are provided to `features.plot`, the  `prev.filter` and `abund.filter` will be overridden.
* `top.k.plot` and `top.k.func`: In many scenarios, especially when navigating through expansive datasets, you may want to focus on a select subset of taxa that stand out either due to their high abundance or  large variability. `top.k.plot` lets you visualize the top k taxa/features based on the criterion you selected in  `top.k.func`, which have four choices:
  * `"mean"`: Highlights taxa with the highest average abundances across samples.
  * `"sd"`: Selects taxa with the greatest variability (standard deviation) across samples, useful for identifying taxa with notable differences under varying conditions.
  * `"prevalence"`: Chooses taxa with the highest occurrence across samples, targeting those most consistently present.
  * `top.k.func` can also accept a user-defined function so that the users can rank taxa based on their own criterion.  The user-defined function should take the abundance matrix (those in `feature.tab` and `feature.agg.list`) as the input and returns a numeric vector of the feature importance values. This allows for criteria beyond "mean", "sd", or "prevalence".


The `generate_taxa_boxplot_long()` places all taxa onto a single page, providing an overview of all your taxa at once.

```r
generate_taxa_boxplot_long(
   data.obj = peerj32.obj,
   subject.var = "subject",
   time.var = "time",
   t0.level = "1",
   ts.levels = "2",
   group.var = "group",
   strata.var = "sex",
   feature.level = c("Genus"),
   feature.dat.type = "count",
   features.plot = NULL,
   top.k.plot = 8,
   top.k.func = "mean",
   transform = "log",
   prev.filter = 0.1,
   abund.filter = 0.001,
   base.size = 16,
   theme.choice = "bw",
   custom.theme = NULL,
   palette = NULL,
   pdf = TRUE,
   file.ann = NULL,
   pdf.wid = 11,
   pdf.hei = 8.5
)
```

Next, we present two key functions, `generate_taxa_indiv_change_boxplot_pair()` and `generate_taxa_change_boxplot_pair()`,  for visualizing the changes from "t1" to "t2".  


```R

   data.obj = peerj32.obj,
   subject.var = "subject",
   time.var = "time",

```

The `generate_taxa_barplot_pair` function will generate starked bar plots of taxa. In each sample pair, the same taxa are connected by lines ito track their abundance changes. The function outputs both individual and averaged bar plots. The function has an important parameter `feature.number`.

* `feature.number`: This parameter determines the maximum number of taxa/features that will be visualized directly in the barplot. For datasets with numerous features, it's practical to limit to the most abundant or significant taxa, ensuring that the visualization remains informative and isn't cluttered. When the number of taxa surpasses the value defined in `feature.number`, the function aggregates low-abundance taxa into a collective category labeled "other". This means, for instance, if there are over 20 features in the dataset but `feature.number` is set to 20, the least abundant features that exceed this count will be collectively presented as "other" in the visualization. This approach ensures that the chart remains legible, highlighting the most dominant features, while still accounting for the contributions of less abundant taxa.

```r
generate_taxa_barplot_pair(
  data.obj = peerj32.obj,
  subject.var = "subject",
  time.var = "time",
  group.var = "group",
  strata.var = "sex",
  feature.level = "Genus",
  feature.dat.type = c("count"),
  feature.number = 30,
  base.size = 10,
  theme.choice = "bw",
  custom.theme = NULL,
  palette = NULL,
  pdf = TRUE,
  file.ann = NULL,
  pdf.wid = 11,
  pdf.hei = 8.5
)
```

The function `generate_taxa_dotplot_pair()` depicts the mean abundance and prevalence across times and  groups. The two time points are visualized together for easy comparison.

```r
generate_taxa_dotplot_pair(
  data.obj = peerj32.obj,
  subject.var = "subject",
  time.var = "time",
  group.var = "group",
  strata.var = "sex",
  feature.level = c("Family"),
  feature.dat.type = "count",
  features.plot = NULL,
  top.k.plot = NULL,
  top.k.func = NULL,
  prev.filter = 0.01,

  pdf.hei = 8.5
)
```

The `generate_taxa_change_dotplot_pair()` function visualizes the mean abundance change and prevalence change across groups:

```r
generate_taxa_change_dotplot_pair(
  data.obj = peerj32.obj,
  subject.var = "subject",
  time.var = "time",
  group.var = "group",
  strata.var = NULL,
  change.base = "2",
  feature.change.func = "log fold change",
  feature.level = "Family",
  feature.dat.type = "count",
  features.plot = NULL,
  top.k.plot = NULL,
  top.k.func = NULL,

  abund.filter = 0.01,
  base.size = 16,
  theme.choice = "bw",

)
```

The `generate_taxa_heatmap_pair()` function creates a heatmap of paired smaples. Here is an example:

```r
generate_taxa_heatmap_pair(
   data.obj = peerj32.obj,
   subject.var = "subject",
   time.var = "time",
   group.var = "group",
   strata.var = "sex",
   feature.level = c("Family"),
   feature.dat.type = "count",
   features.plot = NULL,
   top.k.plot = NULL,
   top.k.func = NULL,
   prev.filter = 0.1,
   abund.filter = 0.001,
   base.size = 12,
   custom.theme = NULL,
   palette = NULL,
   pdf = TRUE,
   file.ann = NULL,
   pdf.wid = 11,
   pdf.hei = 8.5
)
```
Heatmaps are particularly insightful for discerning clusters of microbial families that exhibit similar abundance profiles across different samples.  Heatmaps are particularly insightful for discerning clusters of taxa/features that exhibit similar abundance profiles across amples. By default, the function will only cluster rows (taxa/features) based on their abundance patterns. The columns are ordered by `group.var` and `strata.var`. If users wish to see the taxa in their original order without clustering, they can achieve this by setting `cluster.rows = FALSE`.  The function also allows for column clustering by setting `cluster.cols = TRUE`, which can be instrumental in revealing groups of samples with similar abundance profiles. Note that when `feature.dat.type` is "count” or "proportion", the data will be visualized using proportions. For "other" type, the original scale will be used.
