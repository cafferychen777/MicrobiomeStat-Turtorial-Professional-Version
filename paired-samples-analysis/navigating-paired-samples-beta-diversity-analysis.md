# Beta Diversity Analysis

Welcome to this tutorial on Beta Diversity Analysis within Paired Samples. Our focus here is to understand the variations in microbial community structure across different groups and within individual subjects over time. We aim to identify patterns and extract meaningful insights from microbiome data using various functions provided by MicrobiomeStat.

Before starting with pre-computed data objects, it's beneficial to grasp the utility of `dist.obj` and `pc.obj` in the context of this toolkit. By design, if these aren't provided, `MicrobiomeStat` auto-generates them. The `dist.obj` is computed using the `mStat_calculate_beta_diversity` function. When covariates (`adj.vars`) are identified, the `mStat_calculate_adjusted_distance` function refines the microbial community dissimilarities using a method based on linear models and multidimensional scaling. This process ensures the extracted microbial patterns are not confounded by the specified covariates, thus presenting a more accurate representation of the microbial community structures.

`pc.obj`, in its essence, is derived from the `mStat_calculate_PC` function. While users are free to select between "mds" and "nmds" as their ordination method, in scenarios where `pc.obj` isn't provided beforehand, the toolkit defaults to the "mds" method. Researchers with a penchant for advanced ordination techniques like t-SNE or UMAP can employ external tools to compute results. Subsequently, these results can be reformatted to align with the `pc.obj` structure, facilitating effortless integration with `MicrobiomeStat`.

Further, it's worth noting that the range of distance measures (`dist.name`) supported includes "BC" (Bray-Curtis), "Jaccard", "UniFrac" (unweighted UniFrac), "GUniFrac" (generalized UniFrac), "WUniFrac" (weighted UniFrac), and "JS" (Jensen-Shannon divergence). It's pivotal to understand that some of these methods, especially those like "UniFrac", necessitate the presence of a phylogenetic tree. Thus, prior to leveraging these metrics, ensure that the `tree` component exists within the `data.obj`.

We begin our analysis by statistically testing beta diversity differences using the `generate_beta_change_test_pair()` function. This function fits linear models where the dependent variable is the distance between two points from the same subject in a paired design, relating these beta diversity measures to grouping and covariate variables.

```r
generate_beta_change_test_pair(
  data.obj = peerj32.obj,
  dist.obj = NULL,
  time.var = "time",
  subject.var = "subject",
  group.var = "group",
  adj.vars = c("sex"),
  change.base = "1",
  dist.name = c('BC', 'Jaccard') 
)
```

The function returns coefficient tables with p-values for assessing variable associations with each beta diversity metric. These tables enable rigorous hypothesis testing before visualizing beta diversity changes in paired designs.

| Distance | Term         | Estimate | Std.Error | Statistic | P.Value  |
| -------- | ------------ | -------- | --------- | --------- | -------- |
| BC       | (Intercept)  | 0.175    | 0.0186    | 9.42      | 8.24e-12 |
| BC       | sexmale      | 0.0671   | 0.0217    | 3.09      | 3.58e-3  |
| BC       | groupPlacebo | -0.0157  | 0.0210    | -0.746    | 4.60e-1  |

| Distance | Term         | Estimate | Std.Error | Statistic | P.Value  |
| -------- | ------------ | -------- | --------- | --------- | -------- |
| Jaccard  | (Intercept)  | 0.294    | 0.0246    | 12.0      | 6.04e-15 |
| Jaccard  | sexmale      | 0.0853   | 0.0288    | 2.96      | 5.06e-3  |
| Jaccard  | groupPlacebo | -0.0207  | 0.0279    | -0.744    | 4.61e-1  |

Next, we explore the `generate_beta_ordination_pair()` function. This function generates ordination plots based on the microbial community structures of samples.

```r
generate_beta_ordination_pair(
  data.obj = peerj32.obj,
  dist.obj = NULL,
  pc.obj = NULL,
  subject.var = "subject",
  time.var = "time",
  group.var = "group",
  strata.var = "sex",
  dist.name = c("BC"),
  base.size = 16,
  theme.choice = "bw",
  custom.theme = NULL,
  palette = NULL,
  pdf = TRUE,
  file.ann = NULL,
  pdf.wid = 11,
  pdf.hei = 8.5
)
```

The `generate_beta_change_boxplot_pair()` function is another tool that aids in our beta diversity analysis. This function quantifies the beta diversity changes within individual subjects over time, using metrics like Bray-Curtis dissimilarity.

```r
generate_beta_change_boxplot_pair(
  data.obj = peerj32.obj,
  dist.obj = NULL,
  subject.var = "subject",
  time.var = "time",
  group.var = "group",
  strata.var = "sex",
  change.base = "1",
  dist.name = c('BC'),
  base.size = 16,
  theme.choice = "bw",
  custom.theme = NULL,
  palette = NULL,
  pdf = TRUE,
  file.ann = NULL,
  pdf.wid = 11,
  pdf.hei = 8.5
)
```

The `generate_beta_pc_change_boxplot_pair()` function provides a more granular perspective of our microbial data by elucidating the differences in specific ordination Axes between different groups. The `pc.ind` parameter is used to specify which Principal Coordinates (PCs) or axes to analyze after conducting a Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) or Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS).

```r
generate_beta_pc_change_boxplot_pair(
  data.obj = peerj32.obj,
  dist.obj = NULL,
  pc.obj = NULL,
  pc.ind = c(1, 2),
  subject.var = "subject",
  time.var = "time",
  group.var = "group",
  strata.var = "sex",
  change.base = "1",
  change.func = "absolute change",
  dist.name = c('BC'),
  base.size = 20,
  theme.choice = "bw",
  custom.theme = NULL,
  palette = NULL,
  pdf = TRUE,
  file.ann = NULL,
  pdf.wid = 11,
  pdf.hei = 8.5
)
```

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-10-11 at 15.09.03.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The boxplot created by `generate_beta_pc_change_boxplot_pair()` reveals differences in specific ordination Axes between different groups.

Lastly, the `generate_beta_pc_boxplot_long()` function traces the trajectory of each subject's beta diversity across two time points on specific ordination axes. However, when the number of subjects is large, the individual connection lines can become too cluttered, making the plot difficult to interpret. To address this, we have set a threshold: when the number of subjects (`n_subjects`) exceeds 25, the individual connection lines are replaced with overall connection lines, improving the clarity and readability of the plot.

```r
generate_beta_pc_boxplot_long(
  data.obj = peerj32.obj,
  dist.obj = NULL,
  pc.obj = NULL,
  subject.var = "subject",
  time.var = "time",
  t0.level = "1",
  ts.levels = "2",
  group.var = "group",
  strata.var = "sex",
  dist.name = c('BC'),
  base.size = 20,
  theme.choice = "bw",
  custom.theme = NULL,
  palette = NULL,
  pdf = TRUE,
  file.ann = NULL,
  pdf.wid = 11,
  pdf.hei = 8.5
)
```

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-10-11 at 15.10.07.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The plot from `generate_beta_pc_boxplot_long()` tracks the changes in each subject's microbiome across two distinct time points.

By using these functions, we can gain a comprehensive understanding of the shifts in microbial communities over time and across different groups.
