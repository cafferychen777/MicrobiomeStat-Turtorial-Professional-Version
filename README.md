## **MicrobiomeStat:** Supporting Longitudinal Microbiome Analysis in R

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/cover.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**MicrobiomeStat** is a **specialized tool** for analyzing **longitudinal** and **paired** microbiome data. It can also be used for longitudinal analysis of other omics datatypes as long as the data are properly normalized and transformed. As a special case, cross-sectional and case-control microbiome data analysis will also be supported.

**MicrobiomeStat** depends on packages such as `rlang`, `tibble`, `ggplot2`, `matrixStats`, `parallel`, `ggrepel`, `lmerTest`, `foreach`, `modeest`, `vegan`, `dplyr`, `pheatmap`, `tidyr`, `ggh4x`, `ape`, `GUniFrac`, `scales`, `stringr`, `broom`, and others. We thank the the authors of these packages, whose work has greatly facilitated the development of **MicrobiomeStat**.

We also acknowledge the work by the developers of **microbiomeutilities**, **phyloseq**, **microbiomemarker**, **MicrobiomeAnalyst**, **microbiomeeco**, **EasyAmplicon**, **STAMP**, **qiime2**, **MicrobiotaProcess**, **q2-longitudinal**, **SplinectomeR**, and **coda4microbiome**. Their contributions have significantly advanced the field and inspired us in creating **MicrobiomeStat**.
